# Introduction
A few weeks ago, Jasmine, the owner of Coffely, had reported a potential data breach resulting in her secret recipe getting stolen by James from the IT department. Before the recipe could get into the hands of the competitors, he was apprehended after finding undeniable evidence in his laptop, thanks to our Forensics team's quick investigation.

Now, Jasmine wants to develop an in-house SOC capability for continuously monitoring the critical logs and events to keep an eye on all the activities within the network. She has contacted our team to provide an on-prem resource who can set up a SIEM locally and ingest necessary logs from the different log sources.

Our choice of SIEM is Splunk for this activity. You are tasked with installing and configuring Splunk and integrating the log sources on Linux and Windows OS.
